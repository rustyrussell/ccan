/**
 * strgrp - group/cluster similar strings.
 *
 * strgrp uses the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm[1] to cluster
 * similar strings. It is governed by a threshold which is compared against
 * the computed normalised LCS length for all known groups.
 *
 * As a coarse and not entirely accurate summary, strgrp takes the following
 * steps:
 *
 * 1. For all known strings, calculate the normalised LCS value against the
 * input string
 *
 * 2. Find the maximum normalised LCS value and associated group
 *
 * 3. If the calculated maximum normalised LCS value exceeds the configured
 * threshold add the input string to the group, otherwise create a new group
 *
 * The clustering operation is expensive; LCS on its own is computationally
 * O(mn) on its two input strings and optimally requires O(min(m,n)) memory. In
 * general each input string should be compared against all known strings,
 * giving O(n^2) behaviour of the clustering algorithm on top of the O(mn) LCS
 * similarity measurement.
 *
 * strgrp tries to battle this complexity on several fronts:
 *
 * 1. Coarse reduction of the required comparisons. Each group has a 'key',
 * which is the string that triggered the creation of the group. Input strings
 * are only compared against group keys rather than all known strings, reducing
 * the complexity to the current number of groups rather than all known
 * strings. Note due the pathological case where the number of groups is equal
 * to the number of known strings the algorithm still  has O(n^2) computational
 * complexity
 *
 * 2. Elimination of LCS computations that will never breach the configured
 * threshold. This property can be measured from the length of the input
 * strings, and a negative result avoids invoking the O(mn) behaviour of LCS
 *
 * 3. Caching of input strings and their associated group. By incurring the
 * cost of a map's string hash function we may eliminate all calls to the LCS
 * function for exact matches, potentially reducing the insertion to a
 * constant-time operation.
 *
 * 4. Whilst the data dependencies of LCS prevent internally parallel
 * implementations, LCS as a function can be applied in parallel. The code
 * uses OpenMP to automatically distribute scoring of the input string
 * against group keys across a number of threads.

 * Example:
 *     FILE *f;

 *     struct strgrp *ctx;
 *     struct strgrp_iter *iter;
 *     const struct strgrp_grp *grp;
 *     struct strgrp_grp_iter *grp_iter;
 *     const struct strgrp_item *item;
 *
 *     f = fdopen(0, "r");
 *     #define BUF_SIZE 512
 *     buf = malloc(BUF_SIZE);
 *     ctx = strgrp_new(0.85);
 *     while(fgets(buf, BUF_SIZE, f)) {
 *         buf[strcspn(buf, "\r\n")] = '\0';
 *         if (!strgrp_add(ctx, buf, NULL)) {
 *             printf("Failed to classify %s\n", buf);
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // Re-implement something similar to strgrp_print() via API as an
 *     // example
 *     iter = strgrp_iter_new(ctx);
 *     while(NULL != (grp = strgrp_iter_next(iter))) {
 *         printf("%s\n", strgrp_grp_key(grp));
 *         grp_iter = strgrp_grp_iter_new(grp);
 *         while(NULL != (item = strgrp_grp_iter_next(grp_iter))) {
 *              printf("\t%s\n", strgrp_item_key(item));
