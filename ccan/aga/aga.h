/*
 * Abstract Graph Algorithms
 *
 * This module implements several standard algorithms on "abstract"
 * (directed) graphs.  That is to say rather than requiring a specific
 * concrete representation of the graph, user-supplied callbacks allow
 * the graph to be constructed as it is explored.
 *
 *
 * Node representation
 * ===================
 *
 * Graph nodes are represented by 'struct aga_node'
 *
 * - These will often be embedded in a caller-specific structure
 *   (calling code can then locate its own structures using
 *   container_of)
 *
 * - Nodes are semi-persistent - they MAY be constructed on the fly by
 *   the edge_info callback (see below), but MUST then remain in place
 *   at least as long as the completion of the current graph
 *   algorithm.
 *
 * - Nodes must be initialized with aga_node_init(), either up front,
 *   or as they are constructed on the fly.
 *
 * - The contents of the structure should be treated as opaque by the
 *   caller.
 *
 *
 * Edge representation
 * ===================
 *
 * Graph edges are reported by three caller supplied functions,
 * 'first_edge', 'next_edge' and 'edge_info'.
 *
 * - Edges are identified by a (void *)
 * - The combination of a graph, a node and this (void *) MUST
 *   uniquely identify an edge
 * - Different edges leading from different nodes MAY have the same
 *   (void *) identifier
 * - NULL has a special meaning (indicating there are no more edges
 *   from a given node).
 * - Otherwise, edge identifiers are treated as opaque by aga
 *
 * - Calling first_edge, followed by next_edge repeatedly must iterate
 *   through all the edges leading from node n.
 *
 * - Either first_edge or next_edge may return NULL indicating there
 *   are no further edges from this node
 *
 * - edge_info MAY return a negative value in case of error.  This
 *   will generally abort any aga algorithm which encounters it.
 *
 * - Otherwise edge_info must return 0.  Any other return value will
 *   cause an abort().
 *
 * - edge_info MAY set ei->to to NULL, indicating a "missing" edge,
 *   thus there MAY be more edge identifiers than actual edges from a
 *   given node.  Otherwise, edge_info MUST fill in the ei->to field
 *   with a pointer to the destination node of the given edge
 *
 * - The ei->to field for a returned edge MAY point to an existing
 *   struct aga_node, or it MAY have just been allocated by the edge
 *   callback itself.  If the latter, it MUST have been initialized
 *   with aga_node_init() before the edge callback returns.
 *
 * - If a node is constructed by the edge callback, any subsequent
 *   reference to that node by the edge callback for *any* node and
 *   index MUST use the same pointer.
 *
 * - The ei->icost field MAY be set by the edge_info callback to
 *   indicate the edge's cost / length represented as an integer (of
 *   type aga_icost_t),  Otherwise the cost defaults to 1.
 *
 * Concurrency
 * ===========
 *
 * - Because the algorithms implemented here keep state in the
 *   aga_node structures, only one algorithm can run at a time.
 *   Global state for algorithms is stored in the aga_graph structure.
 *
 * - When you start an algorithm (aga_*_start()) the graph is marked
 *   as in-use.
 *
 * - Subsequent attempts to start an algorithm will fail;
 *   aga_*_start() will return -1.
 *
 * - To release the graph for another algorithm, use aga_finish().
 *
 * - Calling functions associated with one algorithm while another is
 *   running has undefined results.
 *
 * Errors
 * ======
 *
 * - Errors may be reported by the edge_info callback, or may be
 *   detected internally by algorithms.
 *
 * - Algorithms will generally stop running when they encounter an
 *   error; the call which detects the error and subsequent calls will
 *   return a "safe", but otherwise meaningless value.
 *
 * - After an error is encountered aga_error() will return a non-zero
 *   value.  Negative values are reserved for errors reported by the
 *   user supplied edge callback.  Positive values are reserved for
 *   errors detected internally by aga.
 *
 * - Errors are cleared on aga_finish().
